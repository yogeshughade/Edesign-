    "GUIDED_SETUP_ALLOWS": "Guided Design allows you to quickly and easily create a complete design for your residential projects by answering a short list of question and the providing designs for the switchboard, VDO and wiring devices. The design is based on the NFC 15-100 standard and on Schneider Electric best practices. The final design includes a complete bill of material and technical documentation such as Single Line Diagram, front view of the assembled switcboard, incl. labels.",
    
    "WHAT_CAN_I_CREATE": "How can I create a new electrical switchboard?",
    "YOU_HAVE_2_SOLUTIONS": "You can use the guided design and create a new switchboard directly. Create a new switchboard directly by selecting the range, number of rows you need and then design your switchboard by dragging and dropping components to the enclosure.
